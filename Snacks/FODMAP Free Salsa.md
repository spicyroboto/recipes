## Notes
- Both fresh and dried chives work here. Not too much though!
- This was originally adapted from another [recipe](http://fodmapliving.com/sample-page/appetizers/fodmap-free-salsa/), but we've modified it to suit our tastes.
- This can be canned, but [modern tomatoes require more acidity to be safely preserved](https://foodsafety.wisc.edu/assets/preservation/UWEX_addacidtomatoes.pdf). We usually add a proportional amount of white vinegar to ensure it's okay to eat later. _No nacho can be enjoyed if it is neither tasty nor safe_, Decartes once wrote.
