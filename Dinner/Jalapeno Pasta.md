# Improvised Pasta

Prep Time: No idea

Cook Time: No idea

Total Time: 20-45 minutes

## Ingredients
```
3 packs of chives, diced
3-6 chicken thighs (uncertain)
6-7 jalapeños, centres removed, chopped
3/4 cup of cashews, raw
1 tsp dried oregano
1 tsp white pepper
1 cup (maybe?) of chicken stock
1 tsp of potato/corn starch made into a slury with some water
Olive Oil (not your best stuff)
Tomato paste, to taste
Chili flakes, to taste 
```

## Instructions
1. Broil the chopped jalapeños on parchment in the oven with olive oil until browned, stirring as needed
2. Except for the milk, chili flakes, and corn starch, throw everything else into the instant pot
3. Pressure cook until the chicken thighs are obliterated*
4. While this is happening**, start cooking pasta on the stove (Elicoidali was nice, but Penne is totally fine)
5. Temporarily remove the chicken and put it on a plate
6. Puree the contents of the instant pot with an immersion blender
7. Mix in and activate the potato/corn starch slurry
8. Shred the chicken with a fork and re-add it to the pot
9. Add the pasta to pot once it's done
10. Stir in the milk?
11. Add salt, to taste***

*I can't tell you how long this will take
**Also get a plate out and ready for the chicken; the salmonella-critical part will be over
***It's very likely going to need salt I added a lot. Maybe a bit of lime juice for acidity if you went light on tomato paste.
