## Ingredients

    1 inch ginger (2.5 cm)
    14 oz silken/soft tofu (396 g)
    2 Tbsp garlic olive oil
    ½ lb ground pork (227 g; or any other meat/veggies of your choice)
    1 bunch chives
    
    SEASONINGS
    2 ½ Tbsp Doubanjiang (spicy chili bean sauce/broad bean paste) I use 1 ½ Tbsp Doubanjiang (non-spicy) and 1 Tbsp Ladoubanjigang (spicy). You can buy the non-spicy one from this shop online.
    2 Tbsp mirin
    1 Tbsp miso
    1 Tbsp oyster sauce
    ½ Tbsp soy sauce
    1 tsp sesame oil (roasted)
    1 tsp potato starch/cornstarch
    4 Tbsp water

## Instructions

1. Combine all the ingredients for Seasonings (2 ½ Tbsp Chili Bean Sauce and/or Broad Bean Paste, 2 Tbsp mirin, 1 Tbsp miso, 1 Tbsp. oyster sauce, ½ Tbsp soy sauce, 1 tsp sesame oil, 1 tsp corn starch, 4 Tbsp water) in a bowl and mix well together.
2. Mince the ginger finely.
3. Drain the tofu and cut into about 1 inch (2.5 cm) cubes.
4. In a large frying pan, heat oil on medium heat and saute ginger, making sure it doesn't burn. Once fragrant, add the ground pork and break it up with a spatula or spoon.
5. When the meat is no longer pink, add the Seasoning mixture and stir thoroughly.
6. Once the sauce is back to boiling, add the tofu and gently coat the tofu with the sauce. Stir frequently, without mashing up the tofu, until it is heated through. Add the chives and mix just before taking the pan off the heat. Serve immediately.
