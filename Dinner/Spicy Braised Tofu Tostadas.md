# Spicy Braised Tofu Tostadas


Prep Time: 5 minutes

Cook Time: 25 minutes

Total Time: 30 minutes

Yield: 3 servings

## Ingredients

    TOFU
    2 Tbsp (30ml) olive or avocado oil
    ¼ tsp each sea salt and black pepper, plus more to taste
    10 ounces (283g) extra firm tofu, patted dry and crumbled with a fork
    1½ tsp chili powder
    1½ tsp ground cumin
    1 tsp red pepper powder
    1 cup (240ml) chicken broth
    ½ cup (~128g) red salsa

    TOPPINGS
    Avocado (or guacamole)
    Salsa of choice
    Hot sauce
    Cilantro, chopped

## Instructions

1. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the oil.
2. Raise the heat to high and add the crumbled tofu. Cook for 5–6 minutes, stirring frequently, to begin browning. Then add the chili powder, cumin, and red pepper powder. Stir to coat.
3. Add the broth and salsa. Stir to combine, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for at least 15 minutes. The longer it simmers, the more flavor the tofu will absorb. Stir occasionally.
4. Prep any desired toppings at this time.
5. Serve in burritos, in tacos, or atop salads.

### Notes

Braised tofu will keep covered in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, though best when fresh.
