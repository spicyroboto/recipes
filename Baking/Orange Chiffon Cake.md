## Instructions

CAKE
1. Preheat oven to 325F.
2. Separate eggs into two separate mixing bowls, placing egg whites into fridge to cool until needed.
3. In a large bowl, sift flour, then whisk together with 1 cup sugar, baking powder, and salt.
4. Whisk together egg yolks, orange juice, oil, vest, and vanilla until well combined.
5. In a standmixer or using a handbeater, begin beating egg whites until foamy. Add cream of tartar or lemon and whip until soft peaks form. Gradually begin adding the sugar and beat again until eggs hold stiff peaks. 
7. Stir ¼ egg whites into batter until combined. Gently fold remaining egg whites into batter until no streaks remain. For a fluffy cake, be careful not to overmix at this step.
8. Gently spoon batter into a slightly oiled 24cm chiffon cake pan (with removable bottom). Bake for 50-55 minutes, until cake tester inserted comes out clean. 
9. Place cake upside down on cooling rack for one hour. Once cool, run knife around outside, center, and bottom of cake to loosen. Carefully remove base.
10. Once cooled, pour over glaze and decorate with candied oranges.


CANDIED ORANGES
1. In a saucepan, bring sugar, honey, water, and rosemary to a boil, stirring until sugar dissolves. 
2. Reduce heat to a simmer and add orange slices, turning occasionally until slices are shiny and peels begin to become translucent (about 50 minutes).
3. Strain syrup into a jar to use for the cake.
4. Arrange slices in a single layer on a prepared baking sheet.


GLAZE
1. In a bowl, whisk together icing sugar, milk, orange juice, and syrup until smooth.  


### Notes

* Original recipe calls for seven eggs, but I made it with 6 and it turned out fine. 
* Original recipe calls for 2 tbsp of zest, but I would add a little more next time to up the orange flavour (maybe 2½)
* Glaze turned out very sweet. Would try to make thinner next time, with less icing sugar if possible. I also did not have orange leftover, so I used the syrup from candied oranges and a bit of lemon juice as a substitute for the orange juice + syrup
