# Medovik (Russian Honey Cake)


## Ingredients

    CAKE
    1 cup raw honey
    1 cup unsalted butter
    6 large eggs
    2½ tsp baking soda
    1 teaspoon cinnamon
    4 cups cake flour
    1 tsp vanilla extract
    ¼ tsp salt
    
    ICING
    1000ml whipping cream
    1 tbsp raw honey
    
## Instructions

CAKE
1. Preheat oven to 350F.
2. Trace circles around a 9-inch pie or cake pan onto 12 baking-sheet-size pieces of parchment paper. Set aside.
3. In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the sugar, honey and butter over medium heat. Once simmering, cook for 3 to 4 minutes (no specific temperature needed), it should get a faint shade darker and smell wonderful. Remove from heat and whisk in baking soda. Let cool 5 minutes.
4. Crack eggs into a small bowl, and lightly beat. Whisking vigorously the whole time, drizzle the thinnest stream of the eggs into the honey mixture. Do not stop mixing. Continue until all of the eggs are thoroughly whisked in.  
5. Whisk in the vanilla, cinnamon, and salt. 
7. Sift flour into the batter, whisking to completely incorporate. The batter should be completely smooth.
8. Place a piece of parchment tracing-side-down on a baking sheet, and spoon in a heaping 1/3 cup of batter. Use an offset spatula to evenly spread the batter to the edges. 
9. Bake as many layers at a time as possible, for 5 to 6 minutes, until the cake turns a deep caramel color and springs back at the touch. Once all layers are baked, reduce oven temperature to 250F.
10. Once cooled, cut off the edges of the layers to ensure they are perfectly circular. Place trimmed edges back in the oven and bake until they become dry.
11. Allow it to cool, then use a food processor (or bag and rolling pin) to grind into fine crumbs. Cover and set aside.


FROSTING
1. Beat whipping cream with honey until medium firm peaks form.
2. Placing first layer on serving plate, spoon a heaping cup of frosting onto the centre of layer. Spread evenly across the entire layer.
3. Place the next layer on top of the first. Repeat until all layers are placed.
4. Cover and chill overnight.

### Notes

* Using a skewer in the middle of the cake is helpful for preventing the cake from keeping layers from sliding when chilled.
