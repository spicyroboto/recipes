Yields 24 cupcakes

Ingredients:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup white whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1 cup packed dark brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
2 sticks (1 cup) butter, melted and cooled
4 large eggs, beaten
1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Spray 18 (4 ounce) Mason jars with nonstick cooking spray. If you do not have Mason jars, simply line cupcake tray with cupcake liners.
Whisk together all-purpose flour, white whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, kosher salt, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and nutmeg. Set aside.
In a large bowl mix together dark brown sugar, white sugar, melted butter and eggs. Add in dry ingredients and mix until combined. Mix in pumpkin puree and stir until completely combined.
Fill Mason jars a little over half full and bake for 20-25 minutes until the top of your cupcakes spring back and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
Let cupcakes cool and top with clove-spiced cream cheese frosting.
