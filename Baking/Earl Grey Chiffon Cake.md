# Earl Grey Chiffon Cake


## Ingredients

    CAKE
    6 eggs (separated)
    30g granulated sugar (for egg yolks)
    90g granulated sugar (for meringue)
    70g vegetable oil
    80g boiled water
    140g cake flour
    4 tea bags (about 8g if using loose leaf)
    
    TOPPING
    237ml whipping cream
    3 tbsp sugar (or desired amount)
    Raspberries or other fruit for decoration
    
## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350F.
2. Cut teabags and empty into small bowl. Add boiled water and let steep.
3. Separate eggs into two separate mixing bowls, placing egg whites into fridge to cool until needed.
4. Add sugar to egg yolks and whisk. Once the mixture is well combined, whisk in vegetable oil.
5. Once cooled, add the tea to the mix, again mixing well.
6. Using a sifter or other method, whisk in cake flour.
7. In a standmixer or using a handbeater, begin beating egg whites until foamy. Gradually begin adding the sugar and beat again until soft peaks form. 
8. Stir Â¼ egg whites into batter until combined. Gently fold remaining egg whites into batter until no streaks remain. For a fluffy cake, be careful not to overmix at this step.
9. Gently spoon batter into a slightly oiled 24cm chiffon cake pan (with removable bottom). Bake for 50-55 minutes, until cake tester inserted comes out clean. 
10. Place cake upside down on cooling rack for one hour. Once cool, run knife around outside, center, and bottom of cake to loosen. Carefully remove base. 
11. Decorate with whipped cream as desired

### Notes

Original recipe did not turn out very fluffy. Next time, I would recommend adding 1 tbsp of baking powder.
